/*
static_cast:
    - static_cast is used for safer type conversion from one datatype to another datatype.
    - This type of type cast performs a compile time error check if there is no valid type conversion possible
       between given types.
    - static_cast is safer than normal C-style type casting since it doesnot perform an unsafe reinterpretation 
       of data and allows for better type checking

    # syntax
        newType newData = static_cast<newType>(oldData);
